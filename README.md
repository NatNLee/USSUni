Comments on article (critiques look into for potential next steps):


Michael
COVID is not.causing this as much as just accelerating the trends in place for years. Before his death in January, Clayton Christensen said we'd likely see 40-50% of colleges close by 2030. The absolute worst thing we could do now is bail out all these failing institutions that already had one foot in the grave.
Heather May
Very insightful and helpful article (and alarming, but isn't everything these days!) I don't know where you're looking at salaries, but I teach in one of the most expensive cities in the country, at an expensive private college, and our median salary for Full-time Professors is closer to $90K.

The analysis compares schools to themselves, not to any verified or expected standards of performance. 
The instructional expenditure per student metric rewards a school, like U of Chicago, to spend $50K+ to educate a full-time student, when CWRU can do it for $17K and Elon (who will Perish) for $8.5K. Why does the study advantage excessive instructional expenditures, rather than efficiency and optimization--the capabilities that drive viability?
Using endowment is so "old fashioned" as a single sign of financial strength. Higher ed, like most industries, has used a set of strategic financial ratios for 20+ some years, which Forbes aggregates annually into a financial grade.
